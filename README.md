# ChatBot_MakeupRecommendation

This is my virtual ChatBot, Beauty Consultant, built on the OpenAI language model and API. the virtual ChatBot can read a CSV file at a time uploaded by users, answer user's questions about the document based on user inputs, and help users add items to shopping cart. The document shoudl be in CSV format and could be lists of makeup products.

Here are some screenshots about the work of Beauty Consultant:

- user has to input their own unique API key:

- after entering correct API key, user can upload one CSV file:

- then, the chat page will appear for the communication between users and the virtual ChatBot:

- here is one of the function of Beauty Consultant, shopping cart which can be controlled by the ChatBot itself as long as users input certain keywords to ask the ChatBot to do that:
